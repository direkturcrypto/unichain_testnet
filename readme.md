# Unichain Testnet Automation

A Node.js bot to automate transactions on the Unichain testnet. This bot can handle multiple wallets and performs various random transactions to mimic unique activity on the network.

## Features
- **Support for Multiple Wallets**: Easily manages and runs transactions across multiple wallets.
- **ETH -> Token Swap**: Executes swaps from ETH to selected tokens.
- **WETH -> ETH Unwrapping**: Unwraps WETH back to ETH as needed.
- **Token Transfers**: Transfers tokens between wallets.

This bot performs random actions from the above functions, making the transactions appear unique.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env` file)
The following environment variables need to be set:

- `PK`: The private key of the **primary wallet**. This wallet will supply ETH to the bot wallets if they need ETH.
- `INITIAL_ETH_BALANCE`: The initial ETH balance in each bot wallet.
- `MINIMUM_ETH_BALANCE`: The minimum ETH balance required in a bot wallet; if it drops below this threshold, ETH will be transferred from the primary wallet.

### Private Key List (`private_keys.txt`)
Create a file named `private_keys.txt` with a list of your bot wallets' private keys. Add one private key per line.

## Running the Project

Run the following commands to install and start the bot:

```bash
# Install Node.js and npm if not already installed
sudo apt-get install node npm -y
sudo npm i n -g
sudo n latest

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/direkturcrypto/unichain_testnet.git
cd unichain_testnet

# Configure `.env` and `private-keys.txt`
# Update the .env file and add private keys in private-keys.txt

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
node index.js
```

## Notes
Ensure that the primary wallet has enough ETH balance to fund bot wallets as needed.
